### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  I'm a software developer. Over 2020 I learned a lot about front-end web development.Depending on when you are reading this, I am either about to start or am working a full time position at EZTurn as a software engineer. This github has some projects I did over my time as a student learnign to code, and should refelct my growth in knowledge as they become more recent. I hope you enjoy my projects!
